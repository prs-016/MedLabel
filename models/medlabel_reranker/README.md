# CrossEncoder based on cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2

This is a [Cross Encoder](https://www.sbert.net/docs/cross_encoder/usage/usage.html) model finetuned from [cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2) using the [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) library. It computes scores for pairs of texts, which can be used for text reranking and semantic search.

## Usage

### Direct Usage (Sentence Transformers)

First install the Sentence Transformers library:

```bash
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

Then you can load this model and run inference.
```python
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder

# Download from the 🤗 Hub
model = CrossEncoder("cross_encoder_model_id")
# Get scores for pairs of inputs
